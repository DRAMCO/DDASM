## DDASM documentation
DDASM (Digital Design Assembly) is the assembly language supported by the DDASM processor used in the KU Leuven [Digital Design Lab Course](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/JPI228N.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp827408).
The Silicon Simplicity Studio is advised as the IDE for the node.
See the installation procedures [here](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio).

## Configuring your node
 You can change and configure the activation procedure of your node by changing the `./my_lora_device.h` file.

## Message Structure
Currently, the node uses the [LPP format](https://github.com/myDevicesIoT/cayenne-docs/blob/master/docs/LORA.md).
